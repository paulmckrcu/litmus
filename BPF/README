TL;DR:
	"sh runlitmustree.sh /path/to/litmus/tests destdir".

The contents of output directory destdir are deleted using "rm -rf",
so careful!!!

For more details, read on!  Or consult the comment headers and source
code of the individual scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BPFlitmusout.awk

	Provides output_comments() and output_litmus() awk functions to
	pretty-print BPF litmus tests.

c2asmfuncs.awk

	Architecture-independent awk functions for generating
	assembly-language litmus tests.

c2bpf.sh

	Convert the specified C-language LKMM litmus test to BPF.

c2ppc.sh

	Convert the specified C-language LKMM litmus test to PowerPC.

findbpfreadytests.sh

	Search the specified filesystem tree for C-language litmus tests
	that might be converted to BPF.  This script excludes litmus tests
	that are unfriendly to BPF assembly language, such as those using
	locking, RCU, SRCU, or weak memory barriers.  In addition, tests
	with "Result:" outcomes of DEADLOCK or DATARACE are excluded,
	given that BPF assembly language does not have such things.

judgelitmus.sh

	Compare the "Results:" comment in the specified C-language litmus
	test to the result in the specified BPF-language herd7 output.
	If the results are identical, or if the C-language result is
	"Sometimes" and the BPF-output result is "Never", all is well
	and the script terminates with exit code zero.  In this latter
	Sometimes/Never case, judgelitmus.sh outputs "Tighter BPF result
	(OK)".

	Otherwise, the judgelitmus.sh exit code is as follows:

	1:	There is no Results: comment in the LKMM litmus test.
	2:	There is no "Observation" line in the herd7 output.
		This often indicates an error in the original litmus
		test or the BPF translation of it.
	255:	One or both of the input files are unreadable.

runlitmus.sh

	Given a destination directory destdir (whose contents are deleted
	using "rm -rf", so careful!!!) and a one-per-line list on stdin
	of C-language LKMM litmus test pathnames:

	1.	Convert each to BPF using c2bpf.sh.  If successful,
		append the pathname to ${destdir}/0.  Otherwise, append
		the pathname and c2bpf.sh error output to ${destdir}/$?,
		where $? is the c2bpf.sh exit code.

	2.	Run each successfully converted test through herd7.
		Append the pathname of each successful test (as
		in for which herd7 gave an exit code of zero) to
		${destdir}/herd7/0.  Append the pathnames of rest
		of the tests (along with any herd7 stderr output) to
		${destdir}/herd7/$?, where $? is the herd7 exit code.

	3.	For each successful herd7 run, check the Observation line
		of herd7 output against the Result: line of the original
		C-language LKMM litmus test.  If the two match exactly,
		or if the C-language test says Sometimes and the BPF
		test says Never, all is well.  The input pathnames are
		appended, one per line to ${destdir}/judgelitmus/$?,
		where $? is the exit code from judgelitmus.sh.  Each line
		also contains any judgelitmus.sh output, for example,
		"Tighter BPF result (OK)".

runlitmustree.sh

	Given a path to a directory tree containing C-language LKMM litmus
	tests and another path to an output directory (whose contents are
	deleted using "rm -rf", so careful!!!).  The litmus-test tree
	is passed to findbpfreadytests.sh, and the output directory is
	passed to runlitmus.sh.  The output of findbpfreadytests.sh is
	piped to runlitmus.sh.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Destination Directory Layout

"0":
	List of litmus tests that were successfully converted.

exitcode, for example, "1", "2", ...:
	Concatenated stderr from unsuccessful conversion attempted
	in which the c2bpf.sh script exited with this exit code.

"herd7/0":
	List of litmus tests for which herd7 gave a zero (successful)
	exit code.

"herd7/"exitcode
	Concatenated stderr from runs for which herd7 gave a non-zero
	(unsuccessful) exit code.

"judgelitmus/"exitcode
	Concatenated one-liner output from judgelitmus.sh, split out
	on a per-exitcode basis.
